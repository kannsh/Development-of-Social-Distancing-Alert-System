** Running the demo

** Ensure openvino environment has been activated

1. Place the following inside this directory : 

 homography.h IN opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk_18.5.445/inference_engine/samples/pedestrian_tracker_demo/includes

 homography.cpp IN opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk_18.5.445/inference_engine/samples/pedestrian_tracker_demo/src

 main.cpp IN opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk_18.5.445/inference_engine/samples/pedestrian_tracker_demo

 cmakelists.txt IN opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk_18.5.445/inference_engine/samples/pedestrian_tracker_demo

2. change path for homography.cpp (config.txt) and main.cpp (videomap)

3. Place video file in the following : 

 central3.mp4 IN testing-pedestrian/intel64/release


4. cd testing-pedestrian
5. make pedestrian_tracker_demo
6. export models=/opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/intel_models/
7. cd intel64/Release

8. ./pedestrian_tracker_demo                                         -i  ~/testing-pedestrian/intel64/Release/central3.mp4                                                                          -m_det  $models/person-detection-retail-0013/FP32/person-detection-retail-0013.xml                 d_det CPU                     -m_reid $models/person-reidentification-retail-0031/FP32/person-reidentification-retail-0031.xml
